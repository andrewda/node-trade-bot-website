# node-trade-bot-website
This is an example of how to connect your Node.js bot to Socket.io and your website. Feel free to use the examples as a base for your bot and website, but they are in no way production ready and need a lot of touchups. 

If you want to see the Node.js bot, check out [node-trade-bot](https://github.com/andrewda/node-trade-bot).
